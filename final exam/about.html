                <h2><em>About Restaurant</em></h2>
                 <p>Since 1995, Shahi's Diner has been bringing a unique experience to the diner franchise restaurant category.

                    As a business with over 140 locations in 14 states and counting, our brand values, culture
                     and heritage are ready to position you for success. 
                     <img src="img/old rest3.jpg" class="old" alt="Old Picture" width="300" height="200">All trails 
                     lead to a franchise opportunity that satisfies your hunger for success.</p>
                 <p>Born in the small mountain town of Mount Shasta, CA, founders Bruce Dean and Bob Manley created 
                    their first diner with a black bear theme. They wanted it to be a place where family and friends 
                    could be served home-cooked meals with a focus on providing guests with exceptional service. 
                    Their vision also included a community-centered atmosphere, where small-town values like honesty, 
                    integrity and hard work were honored. Over 25 years later, Shahi's Diner is thriving and still
                     serving the same genuine experience.We love to give back to the communities that support our 
                     local Black Bear Diners. Our Dine & Donate is a community/grassroots fundraising program that
                      allows us to partner up with local organizations, schools or churches looking for an idea to
                       raise funds for their cause or purpose.

                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                 <p>Started in 2018, Shahi's Diner supports the Nicaraguan families that grow the single-origin 
                    coffee we serve in our restaurants. <img src="img/old rest2.jpg" class="old" alt="Old picture" width="300" height="200"> The program provides support for infrastructure, medical 
                    and educational-focused activities. Beginning as an internal program, it quickly gained 
                    momentum. Today, our guests can support this important endeavor by purchasing bags of the 100%
                     Nicaraguan coffee at our Diners, with all profits going to fund mountain child initiatives.</p>
                     <p>Our first project is well pump improvement and piping construction. This new system will 
                        bring easily accessible running water to the homes in Mancotal, a community where many of
                         our beans are grown. Shahi's dinner is also funding a medical care van to visit this 
                         relatively remote village where routine medical care is not available and providing 
                         school supplies to the children.</p>

                <h2>Three Shahi's</h2>
                <p>3 Shahi's is a fundraiser in partnership with Gold Country Wildlife Rescue focusing on 
                    providing rehabilitative care to three bears rescued during the 2021 Dixie Fire. Since
                     we announced our support of these three cubs, the Black Bear Community has 
                     raised $17,300 which will go toward enclosures and facility improvements. If you’d
