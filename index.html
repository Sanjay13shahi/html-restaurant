                 <p> Biryani(/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish) or in some cases without any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.[</p> 
                <p>Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Thailand, and Malaysia.[2] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services. </p>

                <p>Today’s <strong> Thai Chicken Curry </strong>is a healthy, one-pan dinner that’s dead simple to prepare and outrageously tasty. Ready in under an hour, this easy Thai curry recipe is fast enough for a weeknight but special enough for company.</p>
                <p>The first time I made this Thai chicken curry, I was worried I would find it lacking.</p>
                 <p>Having eaten copious amounts of authentic Thai curry (and Vegetarian Pad Thai) in Thailand, I know how fabulous a perfect chicken curry can 
                    With a short and <br>simple ingredient list, at least compared to many Thai recipes, I had to wonder how this easy Thai chicken curry could measure up.</p>
